# LLaVA-NeXT-Video Pipeline

## Overview

This pipeline processes soccer videos using **LLaVA-NeXT-Video-7B**, a state-of-the-art vision-language model specifically designed for video understanding. It runs in parallel across 4 GPUs for efficient processing.

### Model Details

- **Model**: `llava-hf/LLaVA-NeXT-Video-7B-hf`
- **Size**: 7B parameters
- **Quantization**: 4-bit (BitsAndBytes NF4)
- **VRAM per GPU**: ~11GB (with optimizations)
- **Specialization**: Video understanding and temporal reasoning
- **Perfect for**: Event detection in sequential video frames

### Memory Optimizations

To fit on Titan RTX 24GB GPUs, the pipeline uses:
- **1 FPS** sampling (instead of 5 FPS)
- **Max 4 frames** per inference window
- **384x384 pixel** max image size
- **OOM error handling** with automatic skip and retry
- **Aggressive memory cleanup** after each window

### Why LLaVA-NeXT-Video?

1. **Video-native architecture** - Designed to understand temporal sequences
2. **Efficient memory usage** - 7B model fits comfortably with 4-bit quantization
3. **Strong visual reasoning** - Excellent at detecting nuanced soccer events
4. **Different perspective** - Complements Qwen's detections for ensemble analysis

## Quick Start

### 1. Copy Scripts to Project Directory

```bash
# Run the setup script to copy files
bash setup_llava.sh

# Or manually:
cp llava_split_worker.py ~/soccer_project/
cp merge_results_llava.py ~/soccer_project/
```

### 2. Set HuggingFace Token

```bash
export HF_TOKEN='hf_YourActualTokenHere'
```

### 3. Run Processing

```bash
# Process all 40 videos
sbatch submit_llava.sh 0 39

# Process first 10 videos (for testing)
sbatch submit_llava.sh 0 9

# Process specific range
sbatch submit_llava.sh 20 29
```

## How It Works

### Processing Flow

```
Video 0 (50 min match)
├── GPU 0: 0-750s    (12.5 min)  ┐
├── GPU 1: 750-1500s (12.5 min)  ├─ Process in parallel
├── GPU 2: 1500-2250s (12.5 min) │
└── GPU 3: 2250-3000s (12.5 min) ┘
         ↓
    Wait for all GPUs
         ↓
    Merge 4 partial results
         ↓
    Deduplicate overlapping events
         ↓
    Save final_predictions_llava_video_0.json
         ↓
    Clean up partial files
         ↓
    Move to Video 1
```

### Temporal Processing

Each GPU processes its time slice with:
- **4-second windows** at 1 FPS (4 frames per window, max VRAM-safe limit)
- **2-second step** (50% overlap to catch events at boundaries)
- **Images resized to 384x384** (maintains aspect ratio)
- **Frames processed as video sequence** (temporal understanding preserved)

Example for GPU 0 (0-750s):
```
Window 1: 0-4s    (4 frames at 1 FPS)
Window 2: 2-6s    (4 frames, overlaps 2s with Window 1)
Window 3: 4-8s    (4 frames, overlaps 2s with Window 2)
...
Window 374: 748-750s (partial window)
```

## Output Format

### Partial Results
```json
[
  {
    "time": 245.0,
    "raw": "{'label': 'Goal', 'team': 'away', 'confidence': 0.95, 'details': 'Player scores from close range'}"
  },
  {
    "time": 247.0,
    "raw": "{'label': 'Goal', 'team': 'away', 'confidence': 0.93, 'details': 'Goal celebration visible'}"
  }
]
```

### Final Merged Results (after deduplication)
```json
[
  {
    "time": 245.0,
    "raw": "{'label': 'Goal', 'team': 'away', 'confidence': 0.95, 'details': 'Player scores from close range'}"
  }
]
```
*(Duplicate at 247.0s removed - same event within 3-second window)*

## Monitoring Progress

### Check Job Status
```bash
# View live processing log
tail -f llava_*.log

# Count completed videos
ls ~/soccer_project/final_predictions_llava_video_*.json | wc -l

# Check specific video event count
python -c "import json; print(len(json.load(open('~/soccer_project/final_predictions_llava_video_0.json'))))"
```

### Expected Timeline

- **Per video**: ~4-6 minutes (varies by event density)
- **10 videos**: ~50 minutes
- **40 videos**: ~3-4 hours

With 6-hour SLURM limit, you have comfortable buffer for all 40 videos.

---

## Comparing with Qwen Results

After processing, you can compare LLaVA and Qwen detections:

```bash
# Count events from both models
for i in {0..39}; do
    qwen_count=$(python -c "import json; print(len(json.load(open('~/soccer_project/final_predictions_qwen7b_video_${i}.json'))))" 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
    llava_count=$(python -c "import json; print(len(json.load(open('~/soccer_project/final_predictions_llava_video_${i}.json'))))" 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
    echo "Video $i: Qwen=$qwen_count, LLaVA=$llava_count"
done
```

### Ensemble Analysis

Use both models to:
1. **High confidence events** - Detected by both models
2. **Model-specific strengths** - Events only one model catches
3. **Disagreement analysis** - Where models differ, requires closer inspection

## Troubleshooting

### Model Download Issues

If the model fails to download:
```bash
# Pre-download the model
python -c "from transformers import LlavaNextVideoForConditionalGeneration; LlavaNextVideoForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('llava-hf/LLaVA-NeXT-Video-7B-hf')"
```

### VRAM Issues

The script is already optimized for 24GB GPUs. If you still get OOM errors:

1. **Check GPU memory**: `nvidia-smi`

2. **Reduce frames per window** in `~/soccer_project/llava_split_worker.py`:
   ```python
   FRAMES_PER_WINDOW = 2  # Change from 4 to 2 (line 23)
   ```

3. **Reduce image size**:
   ```python
   MAX_IMAGE_SIZE = 256  # Change from 384 to 256 (line 27)
   ```

4. **The script auto-skips OOM windows** - Check log for `⚠️ OOM at` messages

5. **If persistent**, reduce TARGET_DURATION to process shorter segments

### Empty Results

If a video produces 0 events:
```bash
# Check partial files
ls ~/soccer_project/partial_results_llava_vid0_gpu*.json

# View sample of what model generated
python -c "import json; d=json.load(open('~/soccer_project/partial_results_llava_vid0_gpu0.json')); print(d[:3])"
```

### Reprocess Specific Video

```bash
# Clean up video 5
rm ~/soccer_project/partial_results_llava_vid5_gpu*.json
rm ~/soccer_project/final_predictions_llava_video_5.json

# Reprocess just video 5
sbatch submit_llava.sh 5 5
```

---

## Cleanup

After processing is complete and you've verified results:

```bash
# Remove all partial files (saves space)
rm ~/soccer_project/partial_results_llava_vid*_gpu*.json

# Keep only final predictions
ls ~/soccer_project/final_predictions_llava_video_*.json
```

## Model Comparison Chart

| Feature | Qwen 2.5-VL 7B | LLaVA-NeXT-Video 7B |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Architecture** | Unified vision-language | Video-specialized |
| **Training** | Images + some video | Extensive video datasets |
| **Temporal reasoning** | Good | Excellent |
| **Memory usage** | ~11GB (4-bit) | ~11GB (4-bit) |
| **Speed** | Fast | Fast |
| **Best for** | General vision + text | Video understanding |

Both models complement each other - use results from both for comprehensive event detection!

---

## Advanced: Adjust Detection Sensitivity

Edit `llava_split_worker.py` to tune event detection:

```python
# Line 158 - Adjust sampling for more/less conservative predictions
output_ids = model.generate(
    **inputs,
    max_new_tokens=256,
    do_sample=True,        # Enable sampling
    temperature=0.7,       # Lower = more conservative (try 0.5-1.0)
    top_p=0.9             # Nucleus sampling
)
```

---

## Next Steps

After running LLaVA pipeline:
1. Compare results with Qwen
2. Analyze which events each model is better at detecting
3. Build ensemble predictions combining both models
4. Benchmark against SoccerNet ground truth
5. Calculate precision/recall metrics per event type

Happy processing! 🎬⚽
